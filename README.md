# angular-material-play
A playground that I use to perform Angular-Material using Angular 1.4 and Webpack.

This application makes use of Webpack to maintain a loose coupling and modularity.  This application bootstraps an AngularJS 1.4 with an Angular-Material dependency.

This is a work in progress to devise what I believe is the best look and feel for the best user experience.
